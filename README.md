## Overview

This paper demonstrates a deep generative modeling approach to predict and visualize the time evolution of microstructures in binary alloys across different composition values. It leverages:

- A **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)** to model the latent space of microstructure images.
- **Cubic Spline Interpolation** to generate intermediate phase labels.
- **Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP)** to ensure smooth morphological transitions between microstructures.

The model replicates the temporal and spatial evolution of microstructures as observed in traditional phase-field simulations, but at a lesser computational cost.
